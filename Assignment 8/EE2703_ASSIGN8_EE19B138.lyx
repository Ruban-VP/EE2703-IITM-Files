Aim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this assignment is to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learn Digital fourier transform (DFT) and its properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use the in-built Python library to generate DFT of various discrete-time
 signals using the Fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Analyse the continuous time fourier transform (CTFT) of continuous-time
 signals by plotting the DFT of their sampled DT versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sampling:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sampling is an important concept in digital signal processing.
 It is the process of creating a discrete-time signal from a known continuous-ti
me signal by sampling it at regular time intervals.
 Also, all the digital devices and computers we use can perform arithmetic
 and algorithms only on discrete data.
 Hence, sampling is a very important concept in signal processing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Let's say the CT signal is 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

.
 Now the sampled DT signal will be:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x[n]=x_{c}(t)|_{t=nT_{s}}=x_{c}(nT_{s})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

 is known as sampling period.
 The associated sampling frequency is:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
ùõ∫_{s}=\frac{2\pi}{T_{s}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
(In this report, ùõ∫ denotes frequency in CT signals and ùúî denotes frequency
 in DT signals)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever we sample a CT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 and obtain a DT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

, their spectra: 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{c}(ùõ∫)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X(ùúî)$
\end_inset

 are related as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(ùúî)=\frac{1}{T_{s}}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_{c}(\frac{ùúî}{T_{s}}-k\frac{2\pi}{T_{s}})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now, the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a bandlimited signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

, the sampling frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

 should be atleast twice the maximum frequency present in the spectrum of
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 in order to prevent overlapping (or Aliasing).
 Only if this condition is satisfied, the DTFT of 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 will preserve the original information about the CT signal.
 A visual representation is shown below:

 Clearly, depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

, we may or may not have aliasing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
To avoid overlapping, we need to satisfy the condition: 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{s}-B>B$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{s}>2B$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the sampling frequency should be atleast twice the maximum frequency
 present in the CT signal to avoid overlapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Digital fourier transform:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Digital fourier transform (DFT) is an important concept in digital signal
 processing.
 As we already saw, we have a continuous variable spectrum pertaining to
 DT signals known as Dsicrete-time fourier transform (DTFT) which is given
 by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(w)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x[n]e^{-jwn}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This is a real variable function and is defined for a continuum of values.
 DFT, on the other hand, is a discrete variable signal and is defined only
 for certain integer values.
 Let's assume we have an N-periodic DT signal, i.e., if we know its first
 N samples 
\begin_inset Formula $(x[0],x[1],...x[N-1])$
\end_inset

, we know the full signal.
 Now, its DFT is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a[k]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x[n]=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{a[k]}{N}e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
and both
\series default
 
\series medium
k and n belong to the set 
\begin_inset Formula ${0,1,2,...N-1}.$
\end_inset

 Also, the DT signal x[n] calculated by the inverse DFT formula is inherently
 periodic with period 'N'.
 Hence, DFT is usually used to analyse periodic DT signals.
 Their values present in one single period contains all information about
 that signal and its DFT.
 Note that both 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 and its DFT 
\begin_inset Formula $a[k]$
\end_inset

 are periodic with period as 'N' samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Connection between CTFT and DFT:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's say we have a finite length CT signal and this signal, when periodically
 extended and sampled, gives us a DT signal.
 Let us define the following functions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 = Finite length CT signal of length 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $X_{fin}(ùõ∫)$
\end_inset

 = CTFT of 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 = Periodic extension of 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 with period 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{0}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{0}$
\end_inset

= Fundamental frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\pi}{T_{0}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}$
\end_inset

= 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 CTFS coefficient of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $X_{c}(ùõ∫)$
\end_inset

 = CTFT of periodic CT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 = Sampled version of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(nT_{s})$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

= Sampling frequency = 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\pi}{T_{s}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $ùúî_{o}$
\end_inset

= DFT resolution frequency = 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{2\pi}{N}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $X(ùúî)$
\end_inset

 = DTFT of signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $a[k]$
\end_inset

 = 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{th}$
\end_inset

 DFT coefficient of signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Let's assume the first N samples that define 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 are given by sampling the 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}$
\end_inset

 period signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t).$
\end_inset

 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}=\frac{T_{0}}{N}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have the following 
\series bold
important
\series default
 equations which relate the spectra of CT signal and the sampled DT signal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{fin}(kùõ∫_{o})=T_{o}a_{k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{c}(ùõ∫)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}2\pi a_{k}\delta(ùõ∫-kùõ∫_{o})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X(\omega)=\frac{1}{T_{s}}\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}X_{c}(\frac{\omega}{T_{s}}-k\frac{2\pi}{T_{s}})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X(ùúî)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{2\pi a[k]}{N}ùõø(ùúî-kùúî_{o})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
(The last equation relates the DTFT and DFT of periodic DT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 in the first period [-
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

).)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, let's assume that the CTFT of the periodic CT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 is bandlimited (or) atleast has a decreasing trend in the fourier series
 coefficients such that we can assume that the spectrum is approximately
 bandlimited after a particular value of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Now, we can choose a sampling frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

 such that the Nyquist criteria is met, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}>2ùõ∫_{m}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{m}$
\end_inset

 is the maximum frequency component present in 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{c}(ùõ∫).$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Any CT frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫$
\end_inset

 we have will become 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫T_{s}$
\end_inset

 in the DT domain.
 Hence, a freqeuncy of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}}{2}$
\end_inset

 in CT domain becomes 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}T_{s}}{2}=\pi$
\end_inset

 in the DT domain.
 So, a range of [
\begin_inset Formula $-ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

) in CT domain becomes [-
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

) in the DT domain.
 Also, since the Nyquist criteria is assumed to be satisfied, we can safely
 say:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X(\omega)=\frac{1}{T_{s}}X_{c}(\frac{\omega}{T_{s}})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
for 
\begin_inset Formula $ùúî\in[-\pi,\pi)$
\end_inset

.
 We are able to get this equation only because Nyquist criteria is satisfied.
 Else, the shifted spectrum terms will also contribute to 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\omega).$
\end_inset

With this assumption, let's see how 
\begin_inset Formula $X(\omega)$
\end_inset

 will be related to the DFT coefficients.
 From equation 
\begin_inset Formula $(4),(5),$
\end_inset

we can say:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{c}(\frac{ùúî}{T_{s}})=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{2\pi.T_{s}.a[k]}{N}ùõø(ùúî-kùúî_{o})=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}2\pi a_{k}\delta(\frac{ùúî}{T_{s}}-k\frac{2\pi}{T_{o}})=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}2\pi.T_{s}.a_{k}\delta(ùúî-k\frac{2\pi}{N})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Since, we have assumed that the CTFS coefficients are limited within [-
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}}{2}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}}{2}$
\end_inset

) in the CT domain, they will be restricted in [-
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

) on the DT domain (or) the w-axis.
 So, our eqn.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(6)$
\end_inset

 reduces to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=-\frac{N}{2}}^{\frac{N}{2}-1}\frac{2\pi.T_{s}.a[k]}{N}ùõø(ùúî-kùúî_{o})=\sum_{k=-\frac{N}{2}}^{\frac{N}{2}-1}2\pi.T_{s}.a_{k}\delta(ùúî-k\frac{2\pi}{N})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Clearly, we have: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
a_{k}=\frac{a[k]}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we also have:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{fin}(kùõ∫_{o})=T_{o}a_{k}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
From eqns.
 
\begin_inset Formula $(7),(8),$
\end_inset

we can say:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
X_{fin}(kùõ∫_{o})=T_{o}\frac{a[k]}{N}=T_{s}a[k]
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The final takeaway point is that if we can safely assume the signal is bandlimit
ed and the sampling frequency satisfies the Nyquist criteria, then the CTFT
 of the finite length CT signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x(t)$
\end_inset

 can be computed at integer values of frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}$
\end_inset

 by multiplying the N-point DFT of the sampled version by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CT frequency interval : [
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-\pi.N}{T_{o}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi.N}{T_{o}}$
\end_inset

)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
CT frequency least count : 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}=\frac{2\pi}{T_{0}}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, to get the CTFT for a higher range, we can either increase 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 or decrease 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}$
\end_inset

 or do both.
 However, the resolution can be improved only by increasing 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}.$
\end_inset

 Hence, when we aim to increase the resolution, the range automatically
 gets shortened.
 To maintain the same range, we need to proportionately increase 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Subsection
Spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(5t)$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sin(5t) is a very simple continuous time periodic function.
 Let's analyse some of its parameters and properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Has a single CT freqeuncy of 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫=5$
\end_inset

 rad/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Spectrum is bandlimited, i.e., only two impulses are present at 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫=\pm5$
\end_inset

 rad/s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since it is periodic, its CTFT will have impulses.
 So, its better to plot its CTFS coefficients.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can write sin(5t) as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
sin(5t)=\frac{e^{j5t}-e^{-j5t}}{2j}=-0.5je^{j5t}+0.5je^{-j5t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Clearly, the CTFS coefficients are -0.5j and 0.5j.
 To get this plot using the DFT of the sampled version, we need to satisfy
 the Nyquist criteria.
 Also, for the Fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithm to work faster, we
 need to choose an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 which is a power of 2.
 Hence, let's choose 
\begin_inset Formula $N=128.$
\end_inset

 Also, let the finite length signal whose periodic representation is 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(5t)$
\end_inset

 have a length of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

, i.e., it is 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(5t)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\in[0,2\pi$
\end_inset

) and zero outside.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}=\frac{2\pi}{128}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}=128$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $128>2*5=10.$
\end_inset

 Hence, Nyquist criteria is also satisfied.
 Now, we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{k}=\frac{a[k]}{N}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
So in our code, after finding the DFT coefficients, we should divide the
 vector by 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to get the CTFS coefficients.
 After doing all that and plotting the magnitude and phase response plots,
 we have the following plot:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

	scale 65

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are peaks of length 0.5 at 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}=\pm5$
\end_inset

 as expected
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The phase is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\pi}{2}$
\end_inset

 at 
\series default

\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}=-5$
\end_inset

 
\series medium
and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{-\pi}{2}$
\end_inset

 at 
\series default

\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}=5$
\end_inset

 
\series medium
as expected.
 Hence, the plot is correct.
 To get a more precise plot, we need to increase 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}$
\end_inset

 as resolution will increase but at the same time, we should increase 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to maintain the same frequency range for which the CTFT (or CTFS) is calculated.
 The plot given below is for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1024$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=8\pi$

Spectrum of amplitude modulated signal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AM modulation is a common technique used in communication of signals.
 A signal which is to be transmitted, will be modulated over a carrier frequency
 so that the modulated signal can be transmitted using antennas of small
 length.
 The modulated signal can be again converted back to the original signal
 using signal processing techniques on the reciever end.
 Let us consider the following example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\[

Now, we have an idea about the fourier coefficients of the FM signal.
 We see that the signal has a bandlimited spectrum with the maximum frequency
 at

 So, in order to prevent aliasing, we just need to choose a sufficient

 Let's assume 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=32\pi$

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}}{2}=4096\frac{\pi}{32\pi}=128>(20+10)=30.$

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now, before procceding forward, we must first analyse some important properties
 of the signal and make some valid approximations based on that.
 The following properties are important:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is not a bandlimited signal (Satisfying Nyquist criteria exactly is impossibl
e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a non-periodic signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a steeply decreasing positive even function and almost looks like
 a finite length signal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since, the gaussian is a non-periodic signal, it's CTFT won't necessarily
 have impulses (Infact, it doesn't have any as we have already derived its
 CTFT).
 So, in order to apply the DFT concepts on it, we must first make a periodic
 CT signal out of it and sample it.
 Let's first define a new finite length signal like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{finite}(t)=exp(\frac{-t^{2}}{2})\forall t\in[-\frac{T_{o}}{2},\frac{T_{o}}{2})
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and the signal is zero outside this interval.
 This new function is not the same gaussian function but a finite piece
 (or window) of it is taken.
 Now, let's find its CTFT:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(Œ©)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}exp(\frac{-t^{2}}{2})exp(-jŒ©t)dt‚âà\int_{-T_{o}/2}^{T_{o}/2}exp(\frac{-t^{2}}{2})exp(-jŒ©t)dt
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Hence, the CTFT of the new finite length function is approximately equal
 to the CTFT of the Gaussian function.
 
\series default
This is the first assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, this signal is periodically repeated and a new periodic signal 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{c}(t)$
\end_inset

 is generated and sampled.
 The first period plot of this signal for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=20$
\end_inset

 would look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This is the first period of the periodic repetition of the finite length
 signal (
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=20)$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
This new periodic function has a period of 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}$
\end_inset

 and hence a fundamental frequency of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{\Omega}_{0}=\frac{2\pi}{T_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the signal will have CTFS coefficients at frequencies which are
 multiples of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{\Omega}_{o}.$
\end_inset

 Now, we already proved in section (2.4) that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(kùõ∫_{o})=T_{o}a_{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
and we know 
\begin_inset Formula $X(ùõ∫)$
\end_inset

 decreases as 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫$
\end_inset

 increases.
 Hence, we can safely say the CTFS coefficients are nearly zero at high
 values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the only final step is to choose a sampling frequency such that we
 can safely assume the CTFT of this periodic signal is bandlimited within
 that range.
 Let's choose 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1024$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=20.$
\end_inset

 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}=\frac{2\pi}{T_{o}}=\frac{\pi}{10}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}=N\frac{2\pi}{T_{o}}=1024\frac{\pi}{10}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{s}$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently high to assume that the Nyquist criteria is satisfied.
 
\series default
This is the second assumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With these two assumptions in mind, we can use all the results we got in
 section (2.4).
 The main result which we want is the following equation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X(kùõ∫_{o})=T_{s}a[k]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Hence, whatever DFT coefficients vector we are getting, we need to multiply
 it by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}$
\end_inset

.
 The resulting coefficients are nothing but the CTFT values of the windowed
 Gaussian signal at integral values of 
\begin_inset Formula $ùõ∫_{o}.$
\end_inset

 The plot given below is for 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}=20$

 And the lowest frequency range in these set of plots is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{ùõ∫_{s}}{2}=512\frac{2\pi}{40}>10$

As already said, whatever plots we are getting is an approximation and not

 That's why we are even getting phase values of

 at high frequencies (Could be due to computer precision and some other
 non-idealities).
 However, the graph we get is fairly accurate in the significant range of
 frequencies, i.e., where the spectrum magnitude is more than 0.001.
 Now, let's see how the maximum error between the computed CTFT values and
 actual CTFT values change with the period.
 We expect a decreasing trend with increasing period as we have already
 seen higher period means better approximation.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The window length 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}(ideal)$
\end_inset

 must be chosen so that the periodic repetition of the windowed gaussian
 almost mimics a sinusoid.
 In that case, the frequency components in the periodic signal would be
 less and hence, the Nyquist criteria will also be satisfied much more accuratel
y.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
However, we have a trade-off here.
 Any increase in the period 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{o}(ideal)$
\end_inset

 will improve the approximation that the CTFT of the windowed signal is
 same as the CTFT of the original gaussian.
 However, now the periodic signal will have more frequency components and
 hence, the Nyquist criteria may not be obeyed fully.
 To resolve this issue, we must increase the value of
