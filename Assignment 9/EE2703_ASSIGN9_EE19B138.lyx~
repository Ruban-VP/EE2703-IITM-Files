Aim:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim of this assignment is to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Learn how DFT is used to analyse spectra of non-periodic DT signals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Analyse spectra of sinusoidal DT signals using and without using hamming
 window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Estimate the frequency and initial phase of a single sinusoid by finding
 its DFT and analysing it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
FInd the DFT of a chirped signal and also plot DFTs of different segments
 of it to see how the frequency components change with time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Theory:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DFT of signals with discontinuities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The DFT and inverse DFT equations are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a[k]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x[n]=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\frac{a[k]}{N}e^{j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
As we can see, both the equations are inherently periodic with period as
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 samples.
 Hence, both the functions 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a[k]$
\end_inset

 are periodic.
 Now, let's say the samples which are at the ends in one period of signal
 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 have a big difference.
 Now, there is a discontinuity in the signal.
 Because of this discontinuity, the spectrum of the signal will contain
 fourier coefficients which will decay as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

.
 So even if the samples are part of a sinusoid, the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 decay will be present if the samples at the end are not so close.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
An example for this 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]=sin(\sqrt{2}t)$
\end_inset

 with the period as 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 Even though the signal is periodic, the time range we took is not a period
 of it.
 So, the periodic extension for period 
\begin_inset Formula $T=2\pi$
\end_inset

 will not produce 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(\sqrt{2}t)$
\end_inset

 but a different signal.
 Hence, the DFT will also not have two impulses but a continuously decreasing
 spectrum.

Signal whose first period (T=

 and

\end_inset

) contains samples of 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(\sqrt{2}t)$
\end_inset

 and the remaining samples are periodic repetitions of the first-period
 samples

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $T=2\pi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=64$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
As we can see, we have peaks around 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 but they are not impulses.
 Rather, we have a continuous spectrum which seems to have a 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 decay.
 But, first of all where does this decay come from? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Gibbs phenomenon:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gibbs phenomenon occurs when a signal contains discontinuites.
 We know sinusoids are continuous signals.
 Hence, when we try to model a discontinuous function as sum (or) integral
 of sinusoids (Definition of fourier transform), logically we will need
 more frequency components to achieve that discontinuity.
 Hence, the spectrum will decay slowly and won't even become zero after
 some frequency, i.e., spectrum won't be bandlimited.
 Let us take the example of a periodic linear ramp with period 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

.
 It's equation is defined as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x(t)=t∀t\in[-\pi,\pi)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
and this segment is periodically repeated to get the periodic linear ramp.
 Clearly, we have discontinuities at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=n\pi$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is an integer.
 Now, the fourier series representation of this signal would be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x(t)=\frac{sin(t)}{1}-\frac{sin(2t)}{2}+\frac{sin(3t)}{3}...
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The spectrum of this signal on a 
\begin_inset Formula $dB-dec$
\end_inset

 plot is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename pics/Figure_4.png
	scale 65

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The spectrum decays linearly with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 on the 
\begin_inset Formula $dB-dec$
\end_inset

 plot indicating 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 delay as expected
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hamming window:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid discontinuities, we use a hamming window.
 This hamming window is another DT signal which will be multiplied with
 the original signal.
 This window signal will be high inside the period and nearly zero at the
 edges.
 Hence, the edge discontinuities are dampened whereas the signal within
 the bulk of the period is preserved.
 An example for a hamming window is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
w[n]=0.54+0.46cos(\frac{2\pi n}{N-1})∀0\leq n<N
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
and this signal is also periodically repeated.
 The new refined signal after the multiplication with the window signal
 is plotted below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename pics/Figure_5.png
	scale 65

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The period is still maintained as 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 and the frequency as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}.$
\end_inset

 But now the discontinuities are reduced because of the multiplication with
 the window signal
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now, let us plot the DFT of this refined signal.
 The DFT of this new signal will be circular convolution of the DFTs of
 the original signal and the window singal (Multiplication in time domain
 leads to convolution in the frequency domain and vice-vera):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{k}=\sum_{n=0}^{N}F_{n}W_{k-n}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Hence, we expect the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 decay to have vanished since the DFT of 
\begin_inset Formula $w[n]$
\end_inset

 only contains components at DC and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\pm1$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, we can write:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G_{k}=F_{k}W_{o}+F_{k+1}W_{-1}+F_{k-1}W_{1}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Clearly, this summation does not exist for all values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 but only at those values of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 where the DFT of 
\begin_inset Formula $x[n]$
\end_inset

 is high.
 So, the DFT of the refined signal will be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The DFT is not accurate but much better when compared to the DFT of the
 unrefined signal
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
We got rid of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 decay but still the peaks are broad.
 We really cannot do anything about it because it's due to the hamming window.
 The convolution sum doesn't decay instantly.
 It exists for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 values which are around 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 and then only becomes zero.
 That's why we have a broad peak even after windowing is done.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
One improvement which we can do to get an relatively accurate spectrum is
 to increase the resolution, i.e, increase the time range (or period) T for
 which it is calculated.
 Let's assume now the signal runs from 
\begin_inset Formula $[-4\pi,4\pi$
\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=257.$
\end_inset

 The signal will look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Here the period is 
\begin_inset Formula $8\pi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=257.$
\end_inset

 Again, we periodically repeat the first period to get the whole periodic
 signal
\begin_inset Newline newline

DFT of this signal is shown below:

Assignment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Spectrum of 
\begin_inset Formula $cos^{3}(0.86t):$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
cos^{3}(w_{0}t)=0.75cos(w_{0}t)+0.25cos(3w_{0}t)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
cos^{3}(w_{0}t)=0.375e^{jw_{0}t}+0.375e^{-jw_{0}t}+0.125e^{j3w_{0}t}+0.125e^{-j3w_{0}t}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Hence, we would expect 4 sharp peaks at the given frequencies.
 However, in this problem, our time range is a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $2\pi$
\end_inset

 which is clearly not a period since 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{o}=0.86.$
\end_inset

 Hence, the periodic repetition won't be 
\begin_inset Formula $cos^{3}(0.86t)$
\end_inset

 and we will be facing the same problems we had with 
\begin_inset Formula $sin(\sqrt{2}t).$
\end_inset

 So, our DFT plot will be continuous with broad peaks at the given frequencies.
 The DFT plot for period time range 
\begin_inset Formula $[-4\pi,4\pi)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=512$
\end_inset

 is given below:

The DFT plot is better when the hamming window is introduced.
 However, the peaks are still broad because of the reasons discussed in
 section 2.3

\begin_layout Subsection
Estimation of frequency and initial phase of a sinusoid using DFT:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DFT plotting could also be used to find the frequency and initial phase
 of a sinusoidal signal.
 If we know that the samples available to us belong to a sinusoid function,
 then we can use its DFT to find the frequency and phase.
 In this problem, it is given that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x(t)=cos(w_{0}t+\delta)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
where 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5<w_{0}<1.5$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary.
 So, let's assume we have the samples ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $[-8\pi,8\pi)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1024.$
\end_inset

 The DFT plot looks as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename pics/Figure_11.png
	scale 65

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is the DFT for 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}=1.2$
\end_inset

 rad/s and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.78$
\end_inset

 rad.
 The peaks are broad as expected
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now let's assume some white noise (Of 
\begin_inset Formula $Amplitude=0.1)$
\end_inset

 is present in the signal.
 This white noise is a gaussian distribution and hence, the magnitude doesn't
 get affected so much.
 There can be some significant changes in the phase spectrum but again,
 the phase values at frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm w_{0}$
\end_inset

 won't get affected very much.
 
\begin_inset Newpage pagebreak
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The DFT plot of the noisy signal is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename pics/Figure_12.png
	scale 65

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The magnitude plot is a bit noisy but the peaks are still intact.
 Phase plot also got affected a bit but the overall structure of the plot
 is preserved
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
The reason for this behavior is because, the DFT of gaussian is another
 gaussian.
 Also, we assumed an amplitude of 0.1.
 So, that's the maximum value the DFT of gaussian can have.
 Hence, both the magnitude and phase of the original plots don't get affected
 to a noticeable extent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now, in order to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta,$
\end_inset

we need to find the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 where the magnitude of DFT is maximum and find the phase there to find
 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
 The proof for this conclusion is given below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a[k](DFT)=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}cos(w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n+\delta)exp(-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn)
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a[k]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}0.5[exp(w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n+\delta)exp(-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn)+exp(-w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n-\delta)exp(-j\frac{2\pi}{N}kn)]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
(
\series default
Note: 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}$
\end_inset

 
\series medium
changed to 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}$
\end_inset

 in DT domain since CT domain frequencies will be scaled by 
\begin_inset Formula $T_{s}=\frac{2T_{0}}{N}$
\end_inset

 in DT domain.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Let's assume we have a 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{0}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}≈\frac{2\pi}{N}k_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Now, the DFT summation becomes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a[k]=\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}0.5[exp(\delta)+exp(-2w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n-\delta)]=0.5Nexp(\delta)+\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}0.5exp(-2w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n-\delta)≈0.5N
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
We are able to discard the final summation because 
\begin_inset Formula $2w_{0}\frac{2T_{0}}{N}n≈\frac{4\pi}{N}k_{0}$
\end_inset

 is N-periodic.
 Hence, whatever phase we find at estimated 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{0},$
\end_inset

that would be almost equal to the actual phase.
 The results that were obtained by following this logic were:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Without white noise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series medium
The estimated frequency w0 = 1.2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

The estimated phase δ (in Rad) = 0.805
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
With white noise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

The estimated phase δ (in Rad) = 0.807
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
DFT of chirped signal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A chirped signal is a signal whose frequency depends on the time instant.
 These type of signals will have different frequency components at different
 time instants.
 The example given in the assignment is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x(t)=cos(16(1.5+\frac{t}{2\pi})t)
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
with 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $[-\pi,\pi).$
\end_inset

 Also, it is asked to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1024.$
\end_inset

 The DFT of the periodic repetition of this signal is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

	scale 60

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As expected, the signal contains frequency components from 16 rad/s to 32
 rad/s and the spectrum decays quickly after that range
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

\series medium
Now in order to analyse how the frequency components depend on the time
 range, let us divide the signal into groups of 64 samples.
 So, we would have 16 such groups.
 By finding the DFT for each group and plotting the DFT magnitude as a 3d
 plot with x-axis as time 
\begin_inset Formula $'t'$
\end_inset

 and y-axis as frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $'w'$
\end_inset

, we will have the following plot:

\align center

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The DFT structure is still the same.
 However, the peaks are present at different locations depending on the
 time

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When viewed from above, we can clearly see the peaks widen up indicating
 the frequencies present in the signal increase with time.
 Also, a linear widening of the peaks mean that the frequencies depend linearly
 on the time value which is also true

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When plotting DFT for signals with discontinuities, the spectrum is not
 merely a collection of distinct spikes but a continuous decreasing spectrum
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\omega}$
\end_inset

 decay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To dampen the discontinuities, a hamming window is used.
 This signal is multiplied with the original signal so that the high frequency
 components get attenuated and hence, the discontinuities are dampened.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Signal 
\begin_inset Formula $cos^{3}(0.86t)$
\end_inset

 has a DFT which has broad peaks and continuous decay.
 However, when a hamming window is used, the continuous decay vanishes but
 still the peaks are broad.

 The results were fairly accurate when the period of the signal is high.
 White noise didn't affect the results much since its amplitude is very
 low.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The chirped signal has frequency components between 16 rad/s and 32 rad/s.
 Also, when the individual DFTs of the 64-samples signals were plotted as
 a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the locations of the peaks widened linearly as 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 increased indicating linear dependence of frequency on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
